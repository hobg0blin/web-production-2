## Reading

#### jQuery

(There’s a lot of these, but they’re all pretty short and part of the [w3Schools jQuery tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp), which is a pretty useful reference)

- [jQuery Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_syntax.asp)
- [jQuery Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp)
- [jQuery Get](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_dom_get.asp)
- [jQuery Set](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_dom_set.asp)

## This Week’s Assignment - Quick Prototype & Proposal 

- This is the first step in the [midterm!](midterm.md)
- [Some APIs to choose from](apis.md)
- Pick an API for your midterm and start getting familiar with it - read the docs, think about what you could build with it.
- If you’re not using one of the APIs from the examples, try making call to the API with the [sample AJAX request](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U-SWOjupG3vuycC2OOKLKnjlW32-Ff04/view?usp=sharing), log the data in the console, and display data from it on a page using jQuery - if you use one of the APIs from the examples, display something else from that API call (e.g. in the Pokemon example, add the Pokemon’s type to the page).
- If you’ve picked an API and are having trouble getting it to work, leave a comment with the error you’re having (or try a different API)
- **Separately**: Once you’ve done some research and played with API calls, [email me](mailto:bb2357@hunter.cuny.edu) a short (~300 word) proposal for your midterm. Include the API you’re planning to use, what your app will do, any challenges/issues you might face, and how you plan to get there. Come to class next week ready to discuss your proposal.

#### Submission

- In your web production 2 folder, create a folder called `week6`
- **IMPORTANT**: if you’re using an API with a key, delete it and put a placeholder - people love to steal API keys from GitHub. Send me your key separately in your email
- Put your quick prototype in the `week6` folder and commit and push to GitHub
- Check and make sure it uploaded to your GitHub page - it should be at {your github username}.github.io/week5/
- Submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ_hzjToD08UX5Py2QP4t8VhiKaIAHZNn6dQVUQbSerfHgrA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
