## Introducing the Final

### Option 1 - Interactive Website
**Create an interactive website that uses Node.js on the server-side and allows the user to interact with it on the front-end. You’ll make a 5-10 minute presentation of your project to the class on December 16. This will be 25% of your grade for the semester!**
- The website should have at least 4 routes delivered by a Node.js server - these can just be `get` routes that deliver different pages, or can be post/put routes for a CRUD app, or can get JSON data from an external API.
- The website should use front-end JavaScript to make it interactive.
- The website should be hosted online - you can use Heroku, turbo360 which we’ll cover next class, or the host of your choice.
- Other than that, it’s up to you! Feel free to build off a previous assignment or your midterm, or code from class tutorials, or build something new entirely!
- Some ideas: 
    - If you’re less comfortable with JavaScript, make a portfolio site or an informational site about a topic you care about. 
    - If you’re more comfortable, try making your own CRUD app: a to-do app, a blog or your own version of a social media site. You can also try working with an external API on the server-side, or something else that’s a good fit for more advanced server-side work.

### Option 2: Roll Your Own Final
- The only hard and fast requirement here is that your project run on a node.js server.
- Want to make a bot,  or a game, or some other personal project you’ve been wanting to work on? Feel free. 
- Just make sure it’s relatively creative and complex: as in the midterm, making a Twitter bot that just posts from the Kanye API doesn’t show much creativity or complexity. Making a discord bot for a community you’re on that does useful things, or making a Twitter bot that interacts with your own custom code or an external API to do something creative, show more of that.

#### Grading Rubric:

- 45% fit and finish: does it look good? Does it do what you set out to do? Does it meet the specs laid out in the midterm assignment? Does it show good effort, even if there are bugs or issues?
- 40% presentation: you’ll give a 5-10 minute presentation that
  - Shows and explains the final work
  - Walks us through your code and development process 
  - Walks us through the problems you ran into and how you solved (or didn’t solve) them. Bugs are to be expected! Tell us what went wrong!
- 15% creativity of concept/implementation: is it a creative concept or implementation? This can mean doing something creative conceptually, doing something interesting or advanced with your code/CSS/HTML, or making animations/graphics with jQuery/p5/CSS. This could also include using advanced programming techniques on the front-end and the server-side: keeping your code DRY, using a database or advanced server functions, or implementing interesting NPM packages.

#### If You’re Worried

- You’ve got a month!
- As with the midterm, we’ll set aside time in the next two classes to work on/discuss your finals.
- As always, bugs are to be expected - this stuff is hard, and takes more than just one 14-week class to master. If you just can’t get something to work, you’re not going to fail.
- Feel free to lean into your strengths: if you’re less comfortable with the server side,you can focus on the front-end, and vice versa.
- That said, if you want to get out of your comfort zone and make something more complex, I encourage you to try, even if you fail: effort will be rewarded, regardless of the result.
- Document your process: take screenshots of work in progress, take notes on different things you did, add comments to your code documenting what you tried, put these in your presentation. I’d rather see a project that doesn’t work where you clearly put it in effort than one that does but is low-effort.
