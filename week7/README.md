## Week 7: Midterm Discussion, Advanced AJAX & jQuery


### If you’re having issues with jQuery & GitHub

Make sure your jQuery script in your HTML is using https, like so:

`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
`

GitHub requires HTTPS - if you’re curious why, more [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/)


## Setup

[Starter Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPoBxyGZueCFyzK7bKvJupmdDP4uo8S4/view?usp=sharing) - download and open in Atom & the browser.


### Examples

These are also in the example folder for this week’s GitHub.

jQuery Animations & AJAX:  
- [TV Maze Slider](https://brondle.github.io/web-production-2/week7/examples/tvmaze-slider/) - a slider using jQuery animations, event handlers, and the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api)
- [TV Maze Slider Zip File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbr-3GtMXN3rZFdI8KGEmwuJzPLBs9Kd/view?usp=sharing)  

Multiple AJAX Requests:
- [Blackjack Game](https://brondle.github.io/web-production-2/week7/examples/deck_of_cards/) - a simple 2-player blackjack game using the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)

## 1: Advanced jQuery - [Tutorial Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bWAbonfRTuLWfeHcauUX0CM5KBwiT8ue/view?usp=sharing)

This is all more advanced jQuery that you might want to (but don’t have to) use in the midterm.

1: In the setup, follow along in the `jquery` folder in Atom and the Browser

  - `keypress`: A demo of using jQuery’s keypress detection
  - `mousemove`: A demo of using jQuery’s built in mouse movement functions.
  - `animations`: A demo of jQuery’s different built-in animation functions and making your own custom animation.

2: Group [exercise](jquery_exercise.md)

- #### [Notes](advanced_jquery.md)


## 2. Advanced AJAX - [Tutorial Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbr-3GtMXN3rZFdI8KGEmwuJzPLBs9Kd/view?usp=sharing)

Again, this is some more advanced AJAX that you don’t have to (or may not need to) use on the midterm, but is good to understand.

1. Follow along in the `ajax` folder in the starter code:
- `pokemon`: making requests to multiple endpoints with pokemon API

2. Group [exercise](ajax_exercise.md)

- #### [Notes](advanced_ajax.md): adding events to pre-written HTML, making multiple API requests, making your own HTML and adding events to it

## 3: Midterm Discussion / Work Session

- [Groups & Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2D6cAk7hymINpG8lRXpKRgsFMRnJeF3R4s4_j8SdlA/edit?usp=sharing)
- Any extra time: work on your midterm! If you haven’t sent in a proposal yet, take this time to look at the [API options](week6/apis.md) and [midterm spec](week6/midterm.md) and start working on one, or ask me any lingering questions.


### Next Week

Next week we’ll spend the first part of the class setting up your servers for the second half of the semester, and the second part of the class in a group midterm work session/taking turns meeting with me one-on-one to discuss your midterm. Come prepared to discuss your progress and any issues you’re having with the midterm with me.


### No homework this week - catch up on homework you’ve missed and work on your midterm - - remember, this is 25% of your grade!
